# Software On My Computer
Literally just a list of all the software (apps/VST plugins, etc.) I have on my computer (Windows 10).
Everything is free, and most of it is open-source.
It's in no particular order.

# Apps:

### Built-in Windows stuff
Obvsiously.

### [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org)
An open-source utility for creating and opening archives.

### [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org)
An open-source program for recording audio. I rarely use it, since I have alternatives with more features, but it's nice to have for some things.

### [AutoHotKey (v2)](https://autohotkey.com)
An open-source utility for creating custom hotkeys, macros, and various other things. I don't use it much, but I have an AHK autoclicker that's useful in some situations.

### [BespokeSynth](https://www.bespokesynth.com)
An open-source modular DAW. It can host 64-bit VST, VST3, LV2, and CLAP plugins, and it has several dozen built-in modules. Bespoke is absolutely incredible, and EVERYTHING can be modulated.



### [Tablacus Explorer](https://tablacus.github.io/explorer_en.html)
I don't have a built-in tabbed file manager, so I use this instead. It may not look as nice and... *Mac-like* (yes, I said it) as that of Windows 11, but it's portable, open-source, works great and is incredibly customizeable, though it does require a bit of learning. I've tried several alternatives, such as [Files](https://files.community), [OneCommander](https://onecommmander.com), and multiple versions of QTTabBar (no link because I don't want to spend ten minutes trying to figure out which one is actually the newest), but Tablacus was just the one I liked more.
