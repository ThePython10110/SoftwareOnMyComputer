# Software On My Computer
Literally just a list of all the software (apps/VST plugins, etc.) I have on my computer (Windows 10).

### Built-in Windows stuff
Obvsiously.

### [Tablacus Explorer](https://github.com/Tablacus/TablacusExplorer)
I don't have a built-in tabbed file manager, so I use this instead. It may not look as nice and... *Mac-like* as that of Windows 11, but it's portable, open-source, works great and is incredibly customizeable, though it does require a bit of learning.
