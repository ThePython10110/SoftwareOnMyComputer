# Software On My Computer
Literally just a(n incomplete) list of all the software (apps/VST plugins, etc.) I have on my computer (Windows 10).
Everything is free (besides the games), and most of it is open-source. None of the links are direct download links (or at least they weren't when I made this list).
An asterisk (\*) means that it's open-source.

<details><summary><h1>Apps:</h1></summary>

### Built-in stuff
Obvsiously.

### [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org)\*
An open-source utility for creating and opening archives.

### [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org)\*
An open-source program for recording audio. I rarely use it, since I have alternatives with more features, but it's nice to have for some things.

### [AutoHotkey (v2)](https://autohotkey.com)\*
An open-source utility for creating custom hotkeys, macros, and various other things. I don't use it much, but I have an AHK autoclicker that's useful in some situations.

### [BespokeSynth](https://www.bespokesynth.com)\*
An open-source modular DAW. It can host 64-bit VST2, VST3, LV2, and CLAP plugins, and it has several dozen built-in modules. Bespoke is absolutely incredible, and EVERYTHING can be modulated.

### [Bulk Rename Utility](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk)
A free (for personal use) utility for renaming multiple files at once.

### [Cakewalk by Bandlab](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk)
This used to be my main DAW, before I discovered Bespoke, and later Waveform. I never actually record anything useful, I just mess around. The main reason I still have it on my computer is that it can host 32-bit plugins (of which I have a few). It hosts 32 and 64-bit VST2, VST3, and DirectX plugins. Its biggest disadvantage, in my opinion, is how annoying it is to get MIDI mapping and automation working. With Waveform, it's literally as simple as clicking MIDI Learn, changing a parameter, then moving a knob. That's how Cakewalk is *supposed* to work, but there's a whole bunch of steps you have to do first, and even after having done those, I still couldn't get it to work.

### [Carla](https://github.com/falkTX/Carla)\*
"Carla is a fully-featured modular audio plugin host, with support for many audio drivers and plugin formats." It's also open-source and runs as a VST2, VST3, CLAP, and LV2 plugin, as well as a standalone app. Although Carla and Bespoke are very similar, I prefer Bespoke for various reasons.

### [Clink](https://mridgers.github.io/clink)\*
Some command prompt utility I literally never use... although looking at the website, maybe I should. I installed it because [`autojump`](https://github.com/wting/autojump)\* depended on it, but then I couldn't get `autojump` working.

### [Discord](https://discord.com)
A chat/communication/messaging software.

### [DISTRHO Cardinal](https://github.com/DISTRHO/Cardinal)\*
An open-source VST2/VST3/LV2/CLAP/standalone version of VCV Rack v2.

### [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com)
An amazing tool that can quickly search every single file on a Windows computer. 

### [EverythingToolbar](https://github.com/stnkl/EverythingToolbar)\*
An easy way to add Everything to the taskbar, made to look like normal Windows Search.

### [Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher)\*
An open-source search utility with plenty of add-ons. I've looked at a lot of these, including [PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys) Run\*, [Keypirinha](https://keypirinha.com/), [ueli](https://ueli.app)\*, and [Wox](https://wox.one)\*.
 
### [Git](https://git-scm.com/)\*
Version control software... I'm assuming if you're reading this list, you know what it is.

### [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)\*
A command line application for Git/GitHub.

### [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)\*
A UI application for Git/GitHub.

### [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome)
Google's web browser. I know it may not necessarily be the fastest or the most secure, but it's the one I use.
 
### [Helios](https://github.com/nickzman/helios)
A nice screensaver
 
### [`midiflip`](https://github.com/1j01/midiflip)\*
A command line utility that can flip MIDI files. It supports wildcards, so you could do something like `midiflip -i "midis/**/*.mid" -o "transformed/"` It requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)\*.

### [Muse Hub](https://www.musehub.com)
An app used to download things like MuseScore 4, Muse Sounds, Audacity, and a couple of other things. But I'm literally going to uninstall this as soon as I finish this list... I hate this app for several reasons. Firstly, I just hate app installers that are also apps that need installation. It just seems ridiculous. Secondly (and most importantly), it installs a service that automatically runs in the background and makes it really annoying to get rid of. Uninstalling Muse Hub doesn't get rid of it, the folder it's in has... weird permissions, and you can't set the service to "manual" because you don't have permissions to do that, and you don't have permission to change the permission. While it could just be the torrent client it claims to be, there's no way to know, since it's not open-source. Basically, if it *is* a virus or something (I doubt it is, but still), it's a very well-designed one. 
 
### [MuseScore](https://musescore.org)\*
An open-source app for creating sheet msuic. I have both MuseScore 3 and MuseScore 4. I rarely use 4 because (in my opinion) it came out of beta *way* too early. It's got tons of bugs and WAY too much built-in unremovable reverb. But the features it adds (mostly the VST3 instrument/effect support) are huge improvements.

### [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)\*
Not entirely sure what exactly this is (a "JavaScript Runtime Environment"), but I know that there a bunch of things that are installed with `npm` (which I assume is the Node Package Manager). I installed this for [`midiflip`](https://github.com/1j01/midiflip)\*.

### [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads)\*
A text/code editor.
 
### [O&O RegEditor](https://www.oo-software.com/en/ooregeditor)
A better registry editor. It's portable.
 
### [Plane9](https://www.plane9.com)
A nice-looking screensaver.
 
### [Plogue Sforzando](https://www.plogue.com/products/sforzando.html)
An SFZ soundfont player, also available as VST2/VST3.
 
### [PowerShell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.3)\*
I installed it one day, wondering what the difference was between Windows PowerShell and PowerShell 7... then discovered it had autocomplete and never used Windows PowerShell again. I've never really gone through any PowerShell tutorials, so I don't know how to actually use it on its own for scripting or anything, but it's nice to have autocomplete.
 
### [PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys)
Several Windows utilities. I mostly just use Always On Top, but occasionally find uses for a couple of the others.
 
### [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org)\*
An SSH/Telnet client. I use it to connect to my Raspberry Pi.

### [Python](https://python.org)\*
A programming language you've probably heard of.

### [QuickLook](https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook)\*
Exactly what it sounds like: Mac's Quick Look for Windows. When a file is selected, pressing space shows information about it.

### [SciTE4AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/scite4ahk)\*
A code editor specifically for AutoHotkey.
 
### [Scoop](https://scoop.sh)\*
A package manager for Windows.

### [Shell](https://nilesoft.org)
A way to modify the default Windows context menu. Support for alternate file managers, such as Tablacus, is somewhat incomplete, and there are some features that don't exist yet, but the developer seems to be pretty quick at fixing bugs.

### [Slack](https://slack.com)
A chat/communication/messaging software, but more business-oriented that Discord.

### [SoundSwitch](https://soundswitch.aaflalo.me/)\*
Switches the audio input/output device with a hotkey. Due to the fact that I use an old audio interface, I occasionally have issues. Sometimes, one of the virtual USB audio ports (from the computer to the audio interface) will just randomly stop working for a few minutes, so I have to switch to another one. This app cuts that process from ten seconds to one.

### [Spitfire Audio App](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/library-manager)
Another installer app.... D: but this one I actually use sometimes, so I'm keeping it. You need it to install several sample libraries, such as LABS and "BBC Orchestra Symphony Discover."

### [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about)
A gaming app that you've probably heard of.

### [SuperF4](https://stefansundin.github.io/superf4)\*
A much faster way to force quit an app than going to Task Manager.
 
### [Surge XT](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io)\*
A VST2/VST3/CLAP/standalone synth. It can do quite a bit.
 
### [Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals)
Way too many Windows utilities, most of which I will *never* use.

### [Tablacus Explorer](https://tablacus.github.io/explorer_en.html)\*
I don't have a built-in tabbed file manager, so I use this instead. It may not look as nice and... *Mac-like* (yes, I said it) as that of Windows 11, but it's portable, open-source, works great and is incredibly customizeable, though it does require a bit of learning. I've tried several alternatives, such as [Files](https://files.community), [OneCommander](https://onecommmander.com), and multiple versions of QTTabBar (no link because I don't want to spend ten minutes trying to figure out which one is actually the newest), but Tablacus was just the one I liked more.
 
### [TX16wX](https://www.tx16wx.com)
A software sampler that can load various soundfonts and other things like that.

### [Unity/Unity Hub](https://unity.com)
A game development environment, which I mostly use to make levels for Human Fall Flat (Unity Hub is the installer)

### [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/Rack)\*
A virtual modular synth, which is only somewhat open-source. The free community version is open-source, while the VST plugin Pro version is not.

### [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)
"It’s how you make software." "What do you want to [code, build, debug, deploy, collaborate on, analyze, learn] today? Visual Studio can do that."

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)\*
An open-source code editor with (quick Google) over 30,000 extensions.

### [Vital Synth](https://vital.audio/)\*
A VST2/VST3/standalone synth. The only source code that has been made publicly available hasn't been updated since April 2022, but it's still source code. I sort of prefer this to Surge XT. They both do similar things, but Vital is much more intuitive, although slightly more CPU-hungry.
 
### [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)\*
An open-source media player with a lot of features.
 
### [Waveform Free](https://www.tracktion.com/products/waveform-free)
Waveform Free is the only DAW I've ever found that has a free version that actually has all the features of the full version. The only difference is that the free version lacks a few built-in plugins (such as the arpeggiator and various effects). But there are free alternatives to all or most of them, so it really is just a DAW. It doesn't even have the usual "free version" things like nag screens, constant reminders that you don't have the full version, and track limits. It also has a really cool plugin rack feature.
 
### [WizTree](https://diskanalyzer.com/)
Basically [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/)\* but much faster and not open-source. It looks through all the files and shows a visual representation of their size. I don't really need this app with a 4TB spinning disk, but it would have been nice to have when I had a 256GB SSD.
 
### [Zoom](https://zoom.us)
If you don't know what this is, you couldn't possibly have been alive during COVID.

<details><summary><h1>Drivers/device-specific software</h1></summary>
 - The driver for an M-Audio Fast Track Ultra (kind of buggy on Windows 10, making me even more hesitant to try Windows 11). The driver is no longer available on the M-Audio website, so I'm not going to put a link here.
 - The [driver](https://m-audio.com/support/download/drivers/usb-midi-series-5.0.1) for an M-Audio KeyRig 25 (or O2 25, since they're literally the exact same device)
 - [A few things](https://www.usa.canon.com/support/p/canoscan-lide-100) for my CanoScan LiDE 100
 - [Software](https://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadlist.aspx?c=us&lang=en&prod=mfc7840w_all&os=10013) for a Brother MFC-7840W
 - [Logitech Unifying software](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025297913). I somehow ended up with three Logitech Unifying mice and one keyboard, all of which are connected to the same receiver.
