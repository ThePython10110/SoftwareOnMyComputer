# Software On My Computer
Literally just a(n incomplete) list of all the software (apps/VST plugins, etc.) I have on my computer (Windows 10).
Everything is free (besides the games), and most of it is open-source. None of the links are direct download links (or at least they weren't when I made this list).
An asterisk (\*) means that it's open-source.

<details><summary><h1>Apps:</h1></summary>

### Built-in Windows stuff
Obvsiously.

### [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org)\*
An open-source utility for creating and opening archives.

### [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org)\*
An open-source program for recording audio. I rarely use it, since I have alternatives with more features, but it's nice to have for some things.

### [AutoHotKey (v2)](https://autohotkey.com)\*
An open-source utility for creating custom hotkeys, macros, and various other things. I don't use it much, but I have an AHK autoclicker that's useful in some situations.

### [BespokeSynth](https://www.bespokesynth.com)\*
An open-source modular DAW. It can host 64-bit VST2, VST3, LV2, and CLAP plugins, and it has several dozen built-in modules. Bespoke is absolutely incredible, and EVERYTHING can be modulated.

### [Bulk Rename Utility](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk)
A free (for personal use) utility for renaming multiple files at once.

### [Cakewalk by Bandlab](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk)
This used to be my main DAW, before I discovered Bespoke, and later Waveform. I never actually record anything useful, I just mess around. The main reason I still have it on my computer is that it can host 32-bit plugins (of which I have a few). It hosts 32 and 64-bit VST2, VST3, and DirectX plugins.

###[Carla](https://github.com/falkTX/Carla)\*
"Carla is a fully-featured modular audio plugin host, with support for many audio drivers and plugin formats." It's also open-source. Although Carla and Bespoke are very similar, I prefer Bespoke for various reasons.

### [Clink](https://mridgers.github.io/clink)\*
Some command prompt utility I literally never use... although looking at the website, maybe I should. I installed it because [`autojump`](https://github.com/wting/autojump)\* depended on it, but then I couldn't get `autojump` working.

### [Discord](https://discord.com)
A chat/communication/messaging software.

### [DISTRHO Cardinal](https://github.com/DISTRHO/Cardinal)\*
An open-source VST2/VST3/LV2/CLAP/standalone version of VCV Rack v2.

### [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com)
An amazing tool that can quickly search every single file on a Windows computer. 

### [EverythingToolbar](https://github.com/stnkl/EverythingToolbar)\*
An easy way to add Everything to the taskbar, made to look like normal Windows Search.

### [Flow Launcher](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher)\*
An open-source search utility with plenty of add-ons. I've looked at a lot of these, including [PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys) Run\*, [Keypirinha](https://keypirinha.com/), [ueli](https://ueli.app)\*, and [Wox](https://wox.one)\*.

### [Tablacus Explorer](https://tablacus.github.io/explorer_en.html)\*
I don't have a built-in tabbed file manager, so I use this instead. It may not look as nice and... *Mac-like* (yes, I said it) as that of Windows 11, but it's portable, open-source, works great and is incredibly customizeable, though it does require a bit of learning. I've tried several alternatives, such as [Files](https://files.community), [OneCommander](https://onecommmander.com), and multiple versions of QTTabBar (no link because I don't want to spend ten minutes trying to figure out which one is actually the newest), but Tablacus was just the one I liked more.

### [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome)
### [Slack](https://slack.com)

# Drivers/device-specific software
 - The driver for an M-Audio Fast Track Ultra (kind of buggy on Windows 10, making me even more hesitant to try Windows 11). The driver is no longer available on the M-Audio website, so I'm not going to put a link here.
 - The [driver](https://m-audio.com/support/download/drivers/usb-midi-series-5.0.1) for an M-Audio KeyRig 25 (or O2 25, since they're literally the exact same device)
 - [A few things](https://www.usa.canon.com/support/p/canoscan-lide-100) for my CanoScan LiDE 100
 - [Software](https://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadlist.aspx?c=us&lang=en&prod=mfc7840w_all&os=10013) for a Brother MFC-7840W
 - [Logitech Unifying software](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025297913). I somehow ended up with three Logitech Unifying mice and one keyboard, all of which are connected to the same receiver.
